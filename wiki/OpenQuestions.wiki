# Issues that don't have a clear solution yet.

  * Should URLs be generated automatically?
  * Do we make use of the existing generic views, use serializers or make both an option? If both, how?
  * How does the interaction between the API and authentication look like? If we want to allow different levels of access for authenticated and unauthenticated users, how should this be configured?
  * Can we make creating resources that don't correspond 1:1 to models easier instead of just changing the type of work that is required to implement them?
