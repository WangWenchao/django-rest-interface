The django-rest-interface project includes two parts:

A) The REST interface: django_restapi

resource.Resource is the generic class for REST resources. Use 
this class for resources that don't necessarily map 1:1 to Django
models. model_resource.ModelResource is an  example of it in
use. Use it when resources map directly to Django models.

responder contains classes you can use to choose which type of 
output format ModelResource returns. For instance, add
"responder = XMLResponder()" to ModelResource's constructor 
call in urls.py in order to use XML as a format.

B) Tests: django_restapi_tests

Contains the API tests. Will be replaced by tests using Russells 
framework. For now, first run runserver.py, then runtests.py in 
order to test the REST interface.
