The django-rest-interface project includes two parts:


A) The REST interface: django_restapi

resource.Resource is the generic class for REST resources. Use 
this class for resources that don't necessarily map 1:1 to Django
models. model_resource.Collection and model_resource.Entry are
specific implementations that map resources 1:1 to Django models.

responder contains classes you can use to choose which type of 
output format ModelResource returns. For instance, add
"responder = XMLResponder()" to ModelResource's constructor 
call in urls.py in order to use XML as a data format.

authentication contains classes you can use to choose which
type of authentication is required to access your API.
For instance, add "authentication = HttpBasicAuthentication()"
to ModelResource's constructor call in urls.py in order to use
HTTP Basic authentication. The default authfunc authenticates 
username and password against django.contrib.auth.models.User.


B) Tests: django_restapi_tests

Contains the API tests. Will be replaced by tests using Russells 
framework. For now, first run runserver.py, then runtests.py in 
order to test the REST interface.
